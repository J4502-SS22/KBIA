		<section class="list">
		<h2 class="listing">William Russell Wallace</h2>
		<p>Pronouns: he/him</p>
		<p>Starting making music: When he was sixteen in high school, over 20 years ago.</p>
		<p>Hometown: Cincinnati, Ohio</p>
		<p>Genre: "It's like a rock and roll Americana very similar to Tom Petty"</p>
		<p>Favorite part about touring: It's a high and it's an adventure you know, it's always different every night. Some nights are terrible, some not so good. But it's weird. It's unpredictable, but yet very predictable. Like, you never know what's going to happen but you're always doing the same thing. It's a weird, weird dynamic that's comforting yet terrifying.”</p>
		<p>Biggest impact COVID-19 made on his life/touring:“I ended up losing like 60, 70 gigs, something like that. Maybe more. So yeah, like it was, like, that's what I was doing for a living and it just went away. So it was pretty intense.”</p>
		<p>Opinion on COVID-19 vaccinations in venues: "Yeah, like, I don't think I would like play at a place that like openly flaunted the rules or anything, but I mostly like just look for a place that that's a cool venue and is going to like, be good about the rules, you know, like, and like they want to take care of their customers like, you know.”</p>
		<p>What booking looks like: He currently does his own booking, but when a record comes out, he hires a publicist because of their expertise with getting reviews and setting up interviews.</p>

		<h2 class="listing">Self Hug</h2>
<p>Interviewed members: Rachel Stevens (she/her) - bass, vocals, social media; Zachary Gaines (he/him) - drums</p>
<p>Additional member(s): Tilden Sullens (he/him) - guitaris</p>
<p>Started making music (together) in: August 2019</p>
<p>Hometown: Columbia</p>
<p>Genre: Alt-Rock/Punk</p>
<p>Favorite part about touring:“Yeah, I feel like people just make communities anywhere. And that's kind of what's happening here. I guess. It's not really a large community. But I do like It's nice seeing the same people come to the shows and like saying hi to them and catching up with them.” - Zachary Gaines</p>
			<p>What booking looks like: Stevens says that despite her “weird love for booking shows,” the shows are still limited all the time.
“There's a lot of shows that have been canceled, moving around, tours have been postponed. So it was kind of just reaching out to everyone again, that I'd been in contact with, you know, the year prior. Yeah, a lot of emailing and bothering people is the main thing.” - Rachel Stevens
However, there is a general consensus among the members that booking has become less of a waiting game:
“I texted someone and said, ‘Hi. We're Self Hug,’ and didn't even send anything.They were just like, ‘Cool. You have the slot whenever you want it here some dates come on the radio. It doesn't matter.’ It’s easier because now they respond.” - Rachel Stevens</p>


			<h2 class="listing">Victoria Danielle</h2>
			<p>Pronouns: she/her</p>
			<p>Started making music in: 2018</p>
			<p>Hometown: St. Louis</p>
			<p>Genre: R&B and Soul</p>
			<p>Favorite part about touring: During the pandemic specifically, “It was definitely a big change in my life. I think that's really what kicked off. We like meeting a bunch of other musicians and being able to write more and just be surrounded by different types of music and things like that. So it was definitely an important time in my life, as I'm sure it was for everyone, but especially artists and musicians as well.”</p>
			<p>Biggest impact COVID-19 made on her life/touring: “I really found that time to be helpful, because it just gave me a lot of space to create and to not be worried about work or school or anything like that. So it was bittersweet.”</p>
			<p>Opinion on COVID-19 vaccinations in venues:  “I think it's like a more personal decision, because, of course, not everybody is going to know that you're vaccinated. And if they feel comfortable with having their mask off, and they've been fully vaccinated, then, you know, I think that's their prerogative. But I also think that people who haven't been should still probably wear the masks and everything. Because it's, you know, it's still an issue for sure.’</p>
			<p>What booking looks like: Josh Reynolds is the person responsible for setting up the soul sessions each month. Since things have started opening up, Victoria says things have started to become easier. She says Reynolds plans to do an eventual tour of Columbia with the group.</p>
